# 1. Create a database called credit_card_classification.

CREATE DATABASE credit_card_classification;
USE credit_card_classification;

# 2. Create a table credit_card_data with the same columns as given in the csv file. Please make sure you use the correct data types for each of the columns.

# 3. Import the data from the csv file into the table. 

## hecho con import wizard

# 4. Select all the data from table credit_card_data to check if the data was imported correctly.

SELECT * FROM credit_card_data1;

# 5. Use the alter table command to drop the column q4_balance from the database, as we would not use it in the analysis with SQL. 
# Select all the data from the table to verify if the command worked. Limit your returned results to 10.

ALTER TABLE credit_card_data1

# 6. Use sql query to find how many rows of data you have.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM credit_card_data1;

# 7. Now we will try to find the unique values in some of the categorical columns:

## What are the unique values in the column Offer_accepted?

SELECT DISTINCT(offer_accepted) FROM credit_card_data1;


## What are the unique values in the column Reward?

SELECT DISTINCT(reward) FROM credit_card_data1;

## What are the unique values in the column mailer_type?

SELECT DISTINCT(mailer_type) FROM credit_card_data1;


## What are the unique values in the column credit_cards_held?

SELECT DISTINCT(credit_cards_held) FROM credit_card_data1;


## What are the unique values in the column household_size?

SELECT DISTINCT(household_size) FROM credit_card_data1
ORDER BY household_size;


# 8. Arrange the data in a decreasing order by the average_balance of the customer. 
# Return only the customer_number of the top 10 customers with the highest average_balances in your data.

SELECT customer_number FROM credit_card_data1
ORDER BY average_balance DESC
LIMIT 10;

# 9. What is the average balance of all the customers in your data?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(average_balance), 2) FROM credit_card_data1;


# 10. In this exercise we will use simple group_by to check the properties of some of the categorical variables in our data. 
# Note wherever average_balance is asked, please take the average of the column average_balance:

## What is the average balance of the customers grouped by Income Level? 
## The returned result should have only two columns, income level and Average balance of the customers. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.

SELECT income_level, ROUND(AVG(average_balance), 2) AS income_avg_balance
FROM credit_card_data1
GROUP BY income_level
ORDER BY income_avg_balance DESC;

## What is the average balance of the customers grouped by number_of_bank_accounts_open? 
## The returned result should have only two columns, number_of_bank_accounts_open and Average balance of the customers. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.

SELECT bank_accounts_open, ROUND(AVG(average_balance), 2) AS accounts_avg_balance
FROM credit_card_data1
GROUP BY bank_accounts_open
ORDER BY bank_accounts_open;


## What is the average number of credit cards held by customers for each of the credit card ratings? 
## The returned result should have only two columns, rating and average number of credit cards held. Use an alias to change the name of the second column.

SELECT credit_rating, ROUND(AVG(credit_cards_held), 2) as avg_num_cards
FROM credit_card_data1
GROUP BY credit_rating
ORDER BY avg_num_cards;


## Is there any correlation between the columns credit_cards_held and number_of_bank_accounts_open? 
## You can analyse this by grouping the data by one of the variables and then aggregating the results of the other column. 
## Visually check if there is a positive correlation or negative correlation or no correlation between the variables.

SELECT bank_accounts_open, AVG(credit_cards_held) AS avg_num_cards
FROM credit_card_data1
GROUP BY bank_accounts_open;

SELECT credit_cards_held, AVG(bank_accounts_open) AS avg_num_accounts
FROM credit_card_data1
GROUP BY credit_cards_held
ORDER BY credit_cards_held;
